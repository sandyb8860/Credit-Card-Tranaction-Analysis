## ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Gathered data from Credit Card Transactions and Customer Details tables.
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query in Power BI.
- Ensured relationships between Client Number (common key).

### **2. Data Modeling & Calculations**
- Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX:
  - Categorized Age Groups and Income Groups using `SWITCH` function.
  - Created a new column:  
    `Revenue = Total Transaction Amount + Interest + Annual Fee`.
  - Built measures for `Current Week Revenue` and `Previous Week Revenue` to calculate growth.

### **3. Dashboard Design**
- Designed two dashboards:
  - **Credit Card Transaction Report** â€“ Focused on transaction performance.
  - **Credit Card Customer Report** â€“ Focused on customer demographics and segmentation.
- Used a mix of charts (bar, line, donut, cards, slicers) for better visualization.
