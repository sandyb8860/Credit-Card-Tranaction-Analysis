# ðŸ“Š Credit Card Transaction & Customer Report â€“ Power BI Dashboard
## ðŸ”¹ Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze credit card transactions and customer behavior to generate actionable business insights.  
The dashboard helps financial institutions and stakeholders:
-  Track revenue, transactions, and interest earned.
-  Understand customer demographics (age, gender, education, job, income groups).
-  Identify credit card usage patterns by category, expenditure type, and customer satisfaction.
-  Monitor weekly and quarterly revenue trends for performance tracking.

## ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed
### **1. Data Preparation**
- Gathered data from Credit Card Transactions and Customer Details tables.
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query in Power BI.
- Ensured relationships between Client Number (common key).

### **2. Data Modeling & Calculations**
- Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX:
  - Categorized Age Groups and Income Groups using `SWITCH`.
  - Created Week Number calculations for weekly trends using `WEEKNUM`.
  - Defined metrics like Total Revenue, Total Transactions, Total Interest Earned, and Total Amount.


### **4. Data Visualization**

Profitability of Card category by Gender

## Business question: Which card tiers or segments drive revenue?

This tree map shows 

- Blue card is the top revenue driver for both males (25.7M) and females (20.45M)

- Male customers generate more revenue across all card tiers.

- Blue cards account for nearly 85% of total revenue; Silver and Gold contribute less than 15%.

## Action: Focus upsell/retention on high-revenue segments; reconsider product features for low-revenue tiers

Credit Score Distribution (Histogram)
## Why: Understand distribution of creditworthiness; spot large low-score clusters.

This Histogram shows

- Majority of customers have satisfaction scores between 3 and 4

- Highest customer count is at score 3 (3,068 people)

- Fewest customers at scores 1 and 2 (1,173 and 1,792)

- Scores 4 and 5 have similar customer numbers (2,099 and 1,976)

## Business action: Tighten credit policies or create monitoring for low-score clusters.

# Credit Utilization Trend (Line chart)

Why: Tracks how utilization evolves â€” rising utilization may precede defaults

<img width="2010" height="1106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38cdbf65-ba9c-4e3b-a7a8-5d0f30ff180b" />

This line charts shows-: 

- Blue card consistently has the highest average utilization ratio (between 0.286 and 0.305) throughout the year.

- Gold and Platinum cards show more variability, with Platinum peaking in August (0.2975) and October (0.3056).

- Silver card remains stable and lowest in utilization (around 0.08â€“0.10 all year).

- Gold card peaks early in the year (0.1738 in Feb) but drops below 0.05 in June, November, and December.

## Action: Identify customers for limit increases (low-risk high-utilization) or intervention for high-risk.
